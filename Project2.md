Design and implement a multisensorial counter (0-9) for a client that does not know the roman numbers. It should allow the user to count up and down from a set start.


# Criterion A: Planning

## Problem definition:
We need to design and implement a multisensorial counter that can count from 0 to 9 up and down from a set number. The client doesn’t know the roman numbers and has a disability. 
The product is being developed because it is important to be inclusive with everyone and we all have the right to be able to count from 0 to 9. There are many similar products that allow disabled users to count numbers, such as watches, traffic lights etc.

## Proposed Solution:
### Design statement:
We will design and implement a multisensorial counter (0-9) for a client that does not know the roman numbers. Specifically, the numbers from 0 to 9 will be presented with light and with sound. So everyone, including disabled people will be able to receive the information. The program will be based on binary code and is constructed using the software Python 3.0. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria A Planning, B Solution Overview, and C Development.


### Justify the software selected:
Python is one of the most accessible programming languages because it is not complicated and has simplified syntax very similar to the English language, which is perfect for beginners. According to PYPL and ZDNet [1], [2], Python is one of the most popular languages with about 30% of programmers use Python as their main programming language, so there is a big Internet community to ask for help. Also, its codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages. Python is an open source and has a lot of  tools, like functions or libraries to complement the code, so you can do practically anything with your code. It is also friendly for the programmers and the users, making it possible to be read even by people who are not programmers. It is easy to implement data structures in Python with built-in insert, append functions. Also, there is a large library of built-in functions in Python.
Finally, we will use an online conversor from Python to C so we can use our program in Arduino.

### Justify the structure of the proposed solution:
Our program has the typical type and it is easy to understand. There are comments on each step, so someone who reads the code can understand easily what is happening. Also, there are functions that make the code simple and variables with names that are understandable.

## Success Criteria
1. The counter has to count from 0 to 9, upwards and downwards.
2. All digits (0-9) will be presented with light and sound at the same time
3. Dots ( · ) will be represented with a light bulb and a sound that last 0.4 seconds, while the lines ( - ) will be represented with a light bulb and a sound that last 1 second.

## What is the personal relevance of the program? Why did you pick the theme?
We want to be inclusive and give opportunities to everyone. So, it is important that all people in the world have access to counting methods. Everyone has the right to have a counter, it shouldn’t matter having a disability. 
That is why we included light bulbs and sound, so that everyone will be able to understand it.
We chose a mix of binary and morse code for our counting system because it can be understandable for all and we personally like the idea of reading lines ( - ) and dots ( · ), as some spies and special forces.
